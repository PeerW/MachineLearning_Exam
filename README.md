## Data Description
For all problems, you work with modified audit fraud data from file audit2.csv. It is a cross-section containing 12 variables for 1550 observations about exhaustive non- confidential data in the year 2015 to 2016 of firms collected from the Auditor Office of India to build a predictor for classifying suspicious firms. In particular, one would like to detect audit fraud (”Risk”). Many potential risk factors are examined from various areas like past records of audit office, audit-paras, environmental conditions reports, firm reputation summary, on-going issues report, profit-value records, loss- value records, follow-up reports etc. After in-depth interview with the auditors, important risk factors are evaluated and scored. Please check the pdf file for a detailed variable description.
